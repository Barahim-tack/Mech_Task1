Robotic legs and joints design 

The angle between the two legs should be kept within an acceptable range so that the load on the legs joints. 
As the angle between the two legs increases, as the angle of the bottom joint on the leg increases, which causes the load on the joint increases as well. 

The suggested angle between the angle is 20 degrees, which makes an inner angle of 80 degrees for the joints of the legs. Moreover, this will make a step of around 17 cm for each angle of 20 degrees between the legs. 

The angle between the two legs can be increased later based on the type of the joints and the load that they can hold.
